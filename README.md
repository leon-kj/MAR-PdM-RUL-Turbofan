# MAR-PdM-RUL-Turbofan  

This repository contains the code, data processing, and experiments for my Matura thesis on Predictive Maintenance of aircraft engines.  
The focus lies on Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation for turbofan engines using the NASA N-CMAPSS dataset.

## Installation  

To get the notebooks working, you'll need to download the dataset from NASA. You can dowload it from [here](https://phm-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/NASA/17.+Turbofan+Engine+Degradation+Simulation+Data+Set+2.zip) (14gb, uncompressed 27gb). Afterwards put all files inside `/data`.
